8,27,3:30 pm,MATH 17,Dmitri Pavlov,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,https://dmitripavlov.org/,Pavlov.jpg,"Proper orbifold cohomology: an introduction",
9,3,3:30 pm,MATH 17,Dmitri Pavlov,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,https://dmitripavlov.org/,Pavlov.jpg,"Introduction to simplicial presheaves","I will give an introduction to the language of simplicial presheaves, which lies at the foundation of modern differential and algebraic geometry.  In particular, I will explain sheaf cohomology in this language."
9,10,3:30 pm,MATH 17,Daniel Grady,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,https://sites.google.com/view/danielgrady/,Grady_Daniel.jpg,"Introduction to equivariant homotopy theory and Elmendorf's theorem","In this talk, I will survey three convenient categories for studying the homotopy theory of spaces equipped with the action of a group.  I will present a theorem of Elmendorf, which shows that all three variants are equivalent."
9,17,3:30 pm,MATH 17,Stephen Peña,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,http://stephenpena.org/,Pena_Stephen.jpg,"Introduction to Higher Topos Theory I","In this talk I will discuss the basics of higher topos theory with an emphasis on the theory's applications to geometry.  Particular emphasis will be placed on diffeological spaces and sheaf toposes."
9,24,3:30 pm,MATH 17,Stephen Peña,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,http://stephenpena.org/,Pena_Stephen.jpg,"Introduction to Higher Topos Theory II","In this talk I will begin by finishing the discussion of a theorem relating infinity toposes and infinity stacks which started last week.  After this, I will give basic results on over-infinity-toposes and bundles over fixed elements.  I will end with a discussion on truncated objects and a correspondence theorem between groupoids internal to an infinity topos and infinity stacks."
10,1,3:30 pm,MATH 17,Rachel Harris,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,http://www.math.ttu.edu/~har51995/,Harris_Rachel.jpg,"Infinity-groups and the internal formulation of groups, actions, and fiber bundles.","In this talk, I will discuss Section 2.2 from the recent paper “Proper Orbifold Cohomology” by Sati and Schreiber in which the concept of groups and group actions are formulated for infinity-toposes.  Externally, these structures are known as grouplike E_n-algebras, but can be constructed internally in a more natural way.  I will define groups, group actions, principal bundles, and fiber bundles."
