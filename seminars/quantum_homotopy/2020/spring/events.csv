1,15,2 pm,MATH 111,Daniel Grady,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,https://sites.google.com/view/danielgrady/,Grady_Daniel.jpg,"Smooth stacks and Čech cocycles 1","This talk will provide an introduction to smooth stacks.  The talk will begin with some motivation and continue with several explicit examples of cocycle data which can be obtained via descent.  The talk will conclude with an outlook of the general theory."
1,22,2 pm,MATH 111,Daniel Grady,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,https://sites.google.com/view/danielgrady/,Grady_Daniel.jpg,"Smooth stacks and Čech cocycles 2","This talk is a continuation of the first.  The talk will begin with a discussion on model structures and Bousfield localization and continue with presentations for the infinity category of smooth stacks.  We will use Dugger’s characterization of cofibrant objects to unpackage cocycle data explicitly in several examples."

2,19,2 pm,MATH 111,James Francese,Department of Mathematics and Statistics,Texas Tech University,,Francese_James.jpg,"Précis on Homotopy Type Theory","I will review the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence, the notion of internal language, the framework of intensional dependent type theory, then Hofmann-Streicher's discovery that identity types have groupoidal structure and Lumsdaine's confirmation that they are actually ∞-groupoids, which via the homotopy hypothesis are identified as topological spaces. I will then describe how HoTT makes this particular idea a theorem, by serving as a synthetic theory of ∞-groupoids which is also apparently “foundational” for mathematics. So mostly a conceptual talk, but I will throw in a range of technical tidbits."
