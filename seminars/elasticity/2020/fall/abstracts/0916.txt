Equilibrium configurations for an energy which is a linear combination of the area and a second term which measures the bending of the boundary have been recently introduced to model thin fluid membranes with elastic boundary components, the Euler-Plateau problem.&nbsp; A natural extension of this problem consists of allowing the boundary curve, regarded as a flexible rod, to twist.&nbsp; This twisting requires an additional term in the energy, leading to the so-called Kirchhoff-Plateau problem.&nbsp; If we replace the rod by a twisted elastic ribbon, then a free boundary equilibrium minimal surface will meet this supporting ribbon at a right angle, so that the twisting energy of the ribbon will be completely determined by the Darboux frame of the surface.&nbsp; Motivated by this, we will discuss equilibrium configurations for the Kirchhoff-Plateau problem where the twisting energy is determined by the Darboux frame. &nbsp; Watch online at 3 PM this Wednesday the 16th via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/99440957634">this Zoom link</a>.
