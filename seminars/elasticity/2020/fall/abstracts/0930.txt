This will be an expository type talk on a field about which the speaker is currently learning.  Proving non-uniqueness for PDEs in fluid is a well-known challenging problem, e.g., the Navier-Stokes equations. In fact, until a few decades ago, a consensus was that while classical techniques lead to proofs of uniqueness for sub-critical PDEs, the bag of tricks to prove non-uniqueness for super-critical PDEs was relatively scant. To the best of my knowledge, the term ``convex integration'' was introduced by Gromov, inspired by the work of Nash and Kuiper on isometric embedding theorems. I will survey a series of breakthrough works by De Lellis, Szekelyhidi Jr., and others that have allowed this convex integration reformulated for PDEs to prove non-uniqueness for various PDEs in fluid. In fact, in the spirit of homotopy-principle o Gromov, these new results remarkably proved not only non-uniqueness but the existence of infinitely many solutions (while two is enough to prove non-uniqueness).
