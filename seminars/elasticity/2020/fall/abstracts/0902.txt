We survey recent results regarding curvature-dependent energy functionals, obtained by variational methods.  &nbsp;Conditions for criticality and stability are discussed along with applications to fixed and free boundary problems.  &nbsp;Results are discussed in general and then specialized to relevant Willmore and p-Willmore surfaces with accompanying simulations. &nbsp;Watch online at 3 PM this Wednesday the 2nd via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/97160157782">this Zoom link</a>.
