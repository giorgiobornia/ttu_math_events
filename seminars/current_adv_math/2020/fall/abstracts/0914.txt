Commutative Noetherian local rings are the abstract form of the ring of germs of regular functions at a point on an algebraic variety. &nbsp;Accordingly, textbooks organize local rings in I hierarchy according to the character of their singularity. &nbsp;However, this “classification” misses “most” rings: &nbsp;A generic local ring does not resemble a local ring of a point on any reasonable variety. &nbsp;In the talk I will describe recent progress in the understanding of generic local rings of codimension 3, in a way the smallest open case.
