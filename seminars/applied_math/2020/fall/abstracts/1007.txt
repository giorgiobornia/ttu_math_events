We considered the generalization of the Einstein model of Brownian motion when the key parameter of the time interval of free jump degenerates via a solution and its gradient. This phenomena manifests in two scenarios: a) when fluid is highly dispersing like a non-dense gas and b) when distance of the flow w.r.t source is so big that velocity and the gradient of pressure are not subject to the linear Darcy equation. In this work we jointly investigate the question of what feature will exhibit particle flows if the time interval of free jump inverse is proportional to the density of the fluids and its gradient. It was shown that in this scenario, the flow exhibits a localization feature, namely: if at some moment of time t0 in the region gradient of pressure or pressure itself is equal to zero then for some T during time interval [t0, t0 + T] there is no flow as well. This directly links to Barenblatt's finite speed of propagation property for degenerate equations.  Method of proof is very different and based on the application of Ladyzhenskaya - De Giorgi iterative scheme and Vespri - Tedeev technique. <a href="/events/seminars/applied_math/2020/fall/abstracts/1007.pdf">PDF available</a>.
