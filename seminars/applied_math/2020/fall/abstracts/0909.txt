Explicit time integrators for parabolic PDE are subject to a restrictive time-step limit, so A-stable integrators are essential. &nbsp;It is well known that although there are no A-stable explicit linear multistep methods and implicit multistep methods cannot be A-stable beyond order two, there exist A-stable and L-stable implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods at all orders. &nbsp;IRK methods offer an appealing combination of stability and high order; however, these methods are not widely used for PDE because they lead to large, strongly coupled linear systems. An s-stage IRK system has s-times as many degrees of freedom as the systems resulting from backward Euler or implicit trapezoidal rule discretization applied to the same equation set. &nbsp;In this talk, I will introduce a new block preconditioner for IRK methods, based on a block LDU factorization with algebraic multigrid subsolves for scalability. &nbsp;I will demonstrate the effectiveness of this preconditioner on the heat equation as a simple test problem, and compare in condition number and eigenvalue distribution, and in numerical experiments with other preconditioners currently in the literature. &nbsp;Experiments are run with IRK stages up to &nbsp;<i>s&nbsp;=&nbsp;7</i>, and it is found that the new preconditioner outperforms the others, with the improvement becoming more pronounced as spatial discretization is refined and as temporal order is increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/events/seminars/applied_math/2020/fall/abstracts/0909.pdf">PDF available</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch online on Wednesday the 9th at 4 PM via <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F97008436481%3Fpwd%3DbHB5Mi9GUFJzbDNUOUF0ZzNGQTN1QT09&data=02%7C01%7CCollin.Smith%40ttu.edu%7Cdc17f7cc81504681137708d84b6d9249%7C178a51bf8b2049ffb65556245d5c173c%7C0%7C0%7C637342281257811341&sdata=b7lVOnGYggtqkeAxoO%2BQeREmDsI%2BiJJdi2zZztRONTw%3D&reserved=0">this Zoom link</a>.
