Explicit time integrators for parabolic PDE are subject to a restrictive time-step limit, so A-stable integrators are essential. &nbsp;It is well known that although there are no A-stable explicit linear multistep methods and implicit multistep methods cannot be A-stable beyond order two, there exist A-stable and L-stable implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods at all orders. &nbsp;IRK methods offer an appealing combination of stability and high order; however, these methods are not widely used for PDE because they lead to large, strongly coupled linear systems. An s-stage IRK system has s-times as many degrees of freedom as the systems resulting from backward Euler or implicit trapezoidal rule discretization applied to the same equation set. &nbsp;In this talk, I will introduce a new block preconditioner for IRK methods, based on a block LDU factorization with algebraic multigrid subsolves for scalability. &nbsp;I will demonstrate the effectiveness of this preconditioner on the heat equation as a simple test problem, and compare in condition number and eigenvalue distribution, and in numerical experiments with other preconditioners currently in the literature. &nbsp;Experiments are run with IRK stages up to &nbsp;<i>s&nbsp;=&nbsp;7</i>, and it is found that the new preconditioner outperforms the others, with the improvement becoming more pronounced as spatial discretization is refined and as temporal order is increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/events/seminars/applied_math/2020/fall/abstracts/0909.pdf">PDF available</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch online on Wednesday the 9th at 4 PM via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/97008436481?pwd=bHB5Mi9GUFJzbDNUOUF0ZzNGQTN1QT09">this Zoom link</a>.
