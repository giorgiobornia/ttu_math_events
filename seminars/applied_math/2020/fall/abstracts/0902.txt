In this talk, I give a particular example in which a deterministic approach seems hopeless and yet a stochastic approach successfully allows us to get a glimpse of physics underneath. &nbsp;The celebrated Helmholtz - Kelvin's conservation of circulation from 1858 states that for a smooth solution to the Euler equations, the circulation around a curve moving with the fluid is a constant in time. &nbsp;Its proof completely breaks down once we add diffusion to the Euler equations, which is the Navier-Stokes equations, and no precise statement could be made for the subsequent 150 years. &nbsp;Remarkably, Constantin and Iyer in 2008 (Iyer's Ph.D. thesis in 2006) showed that if we consider random characteristics (essentially characteristics from PDE graduate course but added by noise), then an analog of the circulation theorem for the Navier-Stokes equations holds and states that the circulation on the loop is given by the average over the circulations of the ensemble of loops at the earlier times. &nbsp;Analogous statements can be made for other equations of hydrodynamics such as magnetohydrodynamics, and Boussinesq systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;Watch online at 4 PM on Wednesday the 2nd via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/97008436481?pwd=bHB5Mi9GUFJzbDNUOUF0ZzNGQTN1QT09">this zoom link</a>
