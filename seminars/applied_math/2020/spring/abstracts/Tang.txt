Numerous engineering systems are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), such as energy systems, swarm robotic systems, and flow systems. Over the past two decades, a continuum version of the integral/ODE backstepping approach, called PDE backstepping, has emerged and provided a new control perspective for PDE systems. This talk will first introduce the PDE backstepping method briefly and then will focus on the application in the cooperative formation control of swarm robotic systems in the 3D space.
