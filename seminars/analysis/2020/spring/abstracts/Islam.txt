We study the long-time asymptotics of prototypical non-linear diffusion equations. Specifically, we consider the case of a non-degenerate diffusivity
function that is a (non-negative) polynomial of the dependent variable of the
problem. We motivate these types of equations using Einstein’s random walk
paradigm, leading to a partial differential equation in non-divergence form. On
the other hand, using conservation principles leads to a partial differential equation in divergence form. A transformation is derived to handle both cases. Then,
a maximum principle (on both an unbounded and a bounded domain) is proved,
in order to obtain bounds above and below for the time-evolution of the solution to the non-linear diffusion problem. Specifically, these bounds are based on
the fundamental solution of the linear problem (the so-called Aranson’s Green
function). Having thus sandwiched the long-time asymptotics of solutions to
the non-linear problems between two fundamental solutions of the linear problem, we prove that, unlike the case of degenerate diffusion, a non-degenerate
diffusion equation’s solution converges onto the linear diffusion solution at long
times. Select numerical examples support the mathematical theorems and illustrate the convergence process. Our results have implications on how to interpret
asymptotic scalings of potentially anomalous diffusion processes (such as in the
flow of particulate materials) that have been discussed in the applied physics
literature.
