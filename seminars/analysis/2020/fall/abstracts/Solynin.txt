We discuss several problems on the total loss of heat by $n$
spherical particles in $\mathbf{R}^3$ as well as questions on the
losses of heat by individual particles. Main question here is
whether or not particles lose less heat if they move closer to
each other in a certain sense. These questions were inspired by
observations on the behavioral habits of sleeping armadillos and
some other warm-blooded animals.
