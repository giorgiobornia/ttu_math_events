1,28,3:30 PM,MATH 110,Daniel Grady,Department of Mathematics,Texas Tech University,https://sites.google.com/view/danielgrady/,Grady_Daniel.jpg,Lifting M-theory fields to cohomotopy  via obstruction theory,"We show that the Postnikov tower for the 4-sphere gives rise to obstruction classes which correctly recover various quantization conditions and anomaly cancellations on the M-theory fields. This further adds weight to the hypothesis that the M-theory fields take values in cohomotopy, rather than cohomology."
