8,25,3:30 PM,MATH 110,James Francese,Department of Mathematics,Texas Tech University,,Francese_James.jpg,Fibrations and Special Structures for Categorified Computability Theory,"In this talk we will examine a result (due to Robin Cockett and Richard Garner) identifying Cockett and Stephen Lack's notion of restriction category as a certain class of 2-categories weakly enriched over a particular base, constructed via Day convolution in a weak double category.  We then suggest some examples from differential geometry, functional and complex analysis, and computability theory which call for a generalization of the restriction category concept, and a strategy for extending Cockett and Garner's structure theory result for ordinary restriction categories to this new setting."
