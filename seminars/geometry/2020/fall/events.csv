8,25,3:30 PM,MATH 110,James Francese,Department of Mathematics,Texas Tech University,,Francese_James.jpg,Fibrations and Special Structures for Categorified Computability Theory,"In this talk we will examine a result (due to Robin Cockett and Richard Garner) identifying Cockett and Stephen Lack's notion of restriction category as a certain class of 2-categories weakly enriched over a particular base, constructed via Day convolution in a weak double category.  We then suggest some examples from differential geometry, functional and complex analysis, and computability theory which call for a generalization of the restriction category concept, and a strategy for extending Cockett and Garner's structure theory result for ordinary restriction categories to this new setting."

9,8,3:30 PM,MATH 110,James Francese,Department of Mathematics,Texas Tech University,,Francese_James.jpg,Overview and Motivation for Special Structures in Categorified Computability Theory,"In this talk, we provide a general overview of a few concepts in computability theory which have motivated our study of restriction categories and related structures: partial combinatory algebras, their so-called functional completeness, and their ability to generate categories known as realizability toposes, with structures known as triposes as an intriguing intermediate step in one account of how realizability toposes may be constructed.  We then introduce Turing categories as a certain categorification of partial combinatory algebras based on restriction categories, and illustrate how some of previous concepts translate into this new setting."
9,15,3:30 PM,MATH 110,Daniel Grady,Department of Mathematics,Texas Tech University,https://sites.google.com/view/danielgrady/,Grady_Daniel.jpg,The homotopy type of the cobordism category I,"This talk is the first in a series which reviews the seminal work of Soren Galatius, Ib Madsen, Ulrike Tillmann, and Michael Weiss.  The main result is a refinement of the Pontryagin-Thom equivalence to a space level equivalence, going between the classifying space of the cobordism category and a certain spectrum.  The authors use this equivalence to prove a conjecture by David Mumford about the cohomology of the mapping class group of Riemann surfaces.  In this first talk, I will begin motivation and review the classical Pontryagin-Thom construction.  I will then describe a categorification of the collapse map, which is claimed to induce an equivalence at the level of classifying spaces.  Various bordism categories will be introduced, all of which will be equivalent.  If there is time, I will introduce the Madsen-Tillmann spectrum."

Then I will review some basics of sheaf theory and discuss the geometric realization (or shape) of sheaves on manifolds.  A sheaf variant of the bordism category will be introduced and it will be shown (next time) that its geometric realization is precisely the classifying space of the bordism category."
