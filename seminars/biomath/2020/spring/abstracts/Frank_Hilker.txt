The management of ecosystems often requires population harvesting.
Examples include fisheries, but also the control of invasive species,
removal of weeds, roguing of infected plants, and regulation of pests
such as forest defoliating insects. Harvesting becomes an intricate
issue when the population is unstable: the joint interplay of population
oscillations, removal, and uncertainty can both augment and diminish
variability in population levels and harvesting efforts. In this talk, I
will use generic mathematical models of single-species population
dynamics in discrete time to study how selected harvesting strategies
(fixed escapement, proportional harvesting, constant catch) and harvest
timing affect population stability and resilience. 

This is joint work with Eduardo Liz, Juan Segura, and Daniel Franco.
