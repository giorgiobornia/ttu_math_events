The electrocardiogram (ECG) has long been used to monitor cardiac health. &nbsp;With each feature of the ECG corresponding to a part of the cardiac cycle, the automated identification of such features can play a role in developing decision-support tools that provide further insight regarding a patientâ€™s clinical status. &nbsp;Although algorithms for carrying out such feature identification are well-studied in adult populations, suitable algorithms are lacking for the pediatric congenital heart disease population. &nbsp;This work presents a framework for identifying representative subsets of ECG beats from large data sets and subsequent steps for automated feature identification. &nbsp;ECG subset selection is performed using methods related to the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), and the approach to feature identification relies on techniques more commonly seen in the informatics and data science communities. &nbsp;With methods that generalize beyond the pediatric congenital heart disease population, both subset selection and feature identification aspects of this work can be used toward real-time analyses for the clinical setting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch online on Tuesday the 8th at 3:30 PM via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/95584204864">this Zoom link</a>.
