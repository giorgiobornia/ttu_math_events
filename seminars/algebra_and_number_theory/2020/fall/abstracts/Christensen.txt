In local algebra, the quotient of the bounded derived category by the subcategory of perfect complexes is often referred to as the
singularity category. The quotient is trivial for a regular ring, and for a Gorenstein ring it is triangulated equivalent the
stable category of maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules or, from our point of view, to the homotopy category of totally acyclic complexes of
finitely generated projective modules. I will give an overview of a few recent papers in which we use the flat--cotorsion theory to extend these ideas to schemes. <br>
