Motivated by the long-standing question of how precisely classical mechanics relates to quantum mechanics (QM), I show how equations discovered in 1927 by Erwin Madelung mathematically relate to the Schrödinger equation and Newtonian mechanics. Historically, Madelung's equations were constitutive for the de-Broglie-Bohm interpretation of QM, considered its first major `hidden variable' formulation. However, even if one takes the less stringent philosophical position of viewing QM as a statistical theory describing ensembles of particles, Madelung's equations provide a deep insight into quantum dynamics, the origin of `(first) quantization' and complex numbers in QM, as well as the classical limit. This provides the basis for viewing the Madelung equations as physically more fundamental than the Schrödinger equation.<br>

Furthermore, if one compares the expectation values of the fundamental observables of position, momentum, energy, as well as angular momentum with the expectation values of the respective, naturally chosen functions in the framework of Kolmogovian probability theory, one is naturally lead to the question whether von Neumann's functional-analytic axiomatization of QM was a consequence of the historical development of QM - rather than empirical necessity - so that an axiomatization in terms of Kolmogorov's framework and differential-geometric evolution equations - such as Madelung's - would be more appropriate. By potentially depriving quantum probability theory of its empirical basis, the question is thus of foundational importance for mathematical probability theory in general. Finally, I will argue for a stochastic interpretation of the Schrödinger theory, as pioneered by Fenyes, Nelson, Bohm and Vigier, placing it in the same class of physical theories as the theory of diffusion.<br>
