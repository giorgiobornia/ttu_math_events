The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) draws the attention of many mathematicians and scientists for its chaotic behavior and its similarity to Navier-Stokes equations. &nbsp;In this present study, Serrin-type regularity of two-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is studied. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/events/seminars/prob_diff_geom_phys/2020/fall/abstracts/Kuramoto-Sivashinsky-3.pdf">PDF available</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch online on Tuesday the 1st at 4 PM via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/93954790424?pwd=U3Rpd08ySU5RMTFVOVJvU3FTUlJIdz09">this Zoom link</a>.
