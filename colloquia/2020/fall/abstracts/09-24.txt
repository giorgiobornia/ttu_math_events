Numerous statistical methods have been developed to explore two confounding epigenetic factors in complex human diseases: genomic imprinting and maternal effects. Full likelihood based statistical methods have been proposed to detect these two effects simultaneously. Such methods, however, have to make strong assumptions concerning mating type probabilities to avoid overparameterization. In this talk, I describe two ways to detect the two epigenetic effects jointly without making strong assumptions about nuisance parameters: 1) a series of robust partial likelihood methods that are applicable to case-control family data or discordant sibpair data with additional siblings. These methods overcome overparameterization by matching affected and unaffected probands of the same familial genotypes and deriving a partial likelihood that is free of the nuisance parameters. 2) a Monte Carlo expectation maximization method that overcomes overparameterization by using mating type probabilities as latent variables. In addition, if time allows, I will also introduce two methods to detect imprinting effect under the assumption of no maternal effect: 1) a Monte Carlo pedigree parental-asymmetry test using both affected and unaffected offspring. 2) a joint test for detecting imprinting and non-imprinting allelic expression imbalance using RNA-seq data based on a reciprocal cross design.&nbsp; Watch online at 3:00 PM this Thursday the 24th via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/96355180883?pwd=SVJnRVEvVzBDQ3JPdDIwYlRydTVVZz09">this Zoom link</a>.
