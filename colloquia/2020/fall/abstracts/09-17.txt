Dynamical systems at the frontiers of mathematics and biology use theoretical perspectives to gain insights into biological processes, as well as allow biological problems to drive the development of novel modeling frameworks.&nbsp; Two broad approaches are used in the field. &nbsp;The first focuses on using mathematics to advance biology. &nbsp;In this approach we apply existing modeling frameworks to biological processes to make predictions and deepen the understanding of the biological mechanisms that give rise to observed behaviors. &nbsp;The second approach allows the complexities of biology to demand new mathematics and leads to the development of novel modeling frameworks. &nbsp;These two approaches have advanced the fields of mathematics and biology. &nbsp;Here, I will highlight examples of collaborative work, where we use these two approaches to shed light on the mathematical and physical properties of many complex biological phenomena. &nbsp;These include a variety of techniques from dynamical systems theory including ordinary, partial, stochastic, and delay differential equations across a span of biological applications including ecological stoichiometry, ecotoxicology, pollination, malaria transmission, salamander pathogens, and cancer.&nbsp; Watch online at 3:00 PM this Thursday the 17th via <a href="https://zoom.us/j/91434278425?pwd=ZThwYWVWNVVSbUFZQmVqeUdpdlRhQT09">this Zoom link</a>.
