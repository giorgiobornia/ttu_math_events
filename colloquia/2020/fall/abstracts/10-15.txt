Long range dependence is a property of stationary stochastic processes that means that observations even very far apart in time are far from being independent. This phenomenon is believed to occur in many applications, including hydrology, finance, climate and others. We argue that one should view long range dependence as a phase transition. In some cases such a phase transition in the extreme values of the process turns out to be closely related to the ergodic-theoretical properties of a certain dynamical system driving the process through its Levy exponent.
