Climate change requires a global perspective to understand the past and explore the future. The impacts of climate change, however, are experienced mainly at the local to regional level.  Downscaling techniques are commonly used to bridge the gap between the spatial scales at which climate is modeled vs. the scales at which impact assessments require climate projections.  One of the most common assumptions made by downscaling is that of stationarity:  that current-day relationships between climate variables, relationships that cannot be directly represented by fundamental physical equations but rather must be parameterized or statistically modeled, hold true under very different future conditions.  As future observations are not yet available, the validity of this assumption is difficult to test.<br>
<br>
Here we quantify the ability of three different statistical downscaling methods (seasonal delta, monthly quantile mapping, and daily asynchronous quantile regression) to reproduce high-resolution projections of current and future mean and extreme temperature and precipitation over North America from courser resolution (Â±200 km) versions of the fields.  We evaluate the performance of the statistical downscaling models using impact-relevant threshold and intensity metrics specifically tied to agriculture, ecosystems, human health, infrastructure, energy demand, and water availability to demonstrate how the validity of the stationary assumption can vary by downscaling approach, geographic location, season, and the quantile of the distribution that is reflected by a given metric.<br>
